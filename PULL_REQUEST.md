# CoreLab Challenge - Frontend

## What has been done

Checked out the requirements and decided to go with Next.js stack + Ant Design and a bit of TailwindCSS

After checking out what I must do I did first the interfacing and abstraction for the backend api, after that I've move onto the React Query for proper caching and mutations.

After proper implementing the backend API using the described techniques I moved onto the design, took a few decisions about how the original UI was not a good experience at least for me and changed a few things to fit my ideas of a better UX.
